      "From: ani@ms.uky.edu (Aniruddha B. Deglurkar) Subject: help: Splitting a trimming region along a mesh  Organization: University Of Kentucky, Dept. of Math Sciences Lines: 28    \tHi,  \tI have a problem, I hope some of the 'gurus' can help me solve.  \tBackground of the problem: \tI have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain, i.e  the mesh is a  \tmapping of a 3d Bezier patch into 2d. The area in this domain \twhich is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered. The trimming \tloop is a set of 2d Bezier curve segments. \tFor the sake of notation: the mesh is made up of cells.  \tMy problem is this : \tThe trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller \tcells bounded by the trimming curve segments. If a cell \tis wholly inside the area...then it is output as a whole , \telse it is trivially rejected.   \tDoes any body know how thiss can be done, or is there any algo.  \tsomewhere for doing this.  \tAny help would be appreciated.  \tThanks,  \tAni. --  To get irritated is human, to stay cool, divine. \n"
